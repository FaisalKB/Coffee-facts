More and more people are using mobile devices to access the web. Nowadays, building a website that is responsive is no longer a nice-to-have; it's a requirement. Thankfully, there are many tools available that developers can use to build a robust, responsive website. This repository demonstrates the use of some of these tools. When used effectively, you can create beautiful layouts for just about any website! The tools and concepts used when completing this project include:

### FlexBox:
As a developer, you cannot expect that the people using your site are looking at it on a desktop computer. It's just as likely that they'll be using a phone or a tabletâ€”both of which have different dimensions than the typical desktop. The layout that you so carefully constructed to look beautiful on your desktop might be completely unusable on an iPhone.Flexbox provides a robust set of tools for developers to solve common layout problems, 
including the problem of building for various screen sizes.
When web pages align content properly, the layouts tend to be much easier to read. 

### Media Queries:
Media queries are a CSS feature that allows content to adapt to different screen sizes, such as mobile and desktop screens. With a simple media query, you can easily modify a website's appearance on different devices. With a simple media query, you can quickly provide a responsive layout to nearly any standard website.

### Progressive Enhancement (Mobile-First Development):
A mobile-first approach involves designing the mobile version of a website first, and then adapting the display to larger screens like a desktop. When you follow a mobile-first approach, you start by building your website with your mobile users' experience in mind.As it turns out, progressive enhancement ensures that there is a good enough user experience on all screens. Designing your pages to work on smaller screens first is the generally accepted approach to making web pages today.
